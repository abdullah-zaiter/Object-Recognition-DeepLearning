# Object-Recognition-DeepLearning
Source code added, in jupyter for better visualization and analysis.
The source code runs many neural network topologies with different kernel sizes, layers and other parameters; and saves the results of each one so that a comparision can be done later.
Used anaconda enviroment.

### Used modules:
		- numpy
		- keras
		- os
		- scipy.misc
		- skimage
		- imageio
		- matplotlib.pyplot
		- tensorflow
		- pandas
		- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
		- scipy.io

### NNRs were trained on a Computer with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070
### Used caltech101 database
